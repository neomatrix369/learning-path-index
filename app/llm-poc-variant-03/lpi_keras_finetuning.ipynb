These models are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models available in English, with open weights provided for both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions. Gemma models excel in a range of text generation tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their compact size allows for deployment in resource-constrained environments like laptops, desktops, or personal cloud infrastructure, making state-of-the-art AI models more accessible and encouraging innovation for all.\n",

        "Gemma 2 represent the 2nd generation of Gemma models. These models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety of sources. The **27B** model was trained with **13 trillion** tokens, the **9B** model was trained with **8 trillion tokens**, and **2B** model was trained with **2 trillion** tokens. Here is a summary of their key components:\n",
        "* **Web Documents**: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. Primarily English-language content.\n",
        "* **Code**: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate code or understand code-related questions.\n",

The number of trainable parameters during fine-tunning will decrease therefore considerably. According to **LoRA** paper, this number decreases **10,000 times**, and the computational resources size decreases 3 times."
