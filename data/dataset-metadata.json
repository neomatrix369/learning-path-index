It started off as an idea during the post **KaggleX Cohort 2** brainstorming and feedback session. It was one of the ideas to create byte-sized learning material to help our KaggleX mentees learn things faster. It aspires to simplify the process of finding, evaluating and selecting the most fitting educational resources.\n\n# Context\nThis dataset was meticulously curated to assist learners in navigating the vast landscape of Data Science, Machine Learning and AI education. It serves as a compass for those aiming to develop their skills and expertise in these rapidly evolving fields.\n\n\n# Sources\nThe dataset compiles data from a curated selection of reputable sources including leading educational platforms such as **Google Developer, Google Cloud Skill Boost, IBM, Fast AI** etc. By drawing from these trusted sources, we ensure that the data is both accurate and pertinent.\n\n# Content\nThe dataset encompasses the following attributes:\n\n- **Course / Learning Material:** The title of the Data Science, Machine Learning or AI course or learning material.\n- **Source:** The provider or institution offering the course.\n- **Course Level:** The proficiency level, ranging from Beginner to Advanced.\n- **Type (Free or Paid):** Indicates whether the course is available for free or requires payment.\n- **Module:** Specific module or section within the course.\n- **Duration:** The estimated time required to complete the module or course.\n- **Module / Sub-module Difficulty Level:** The complexity level of the module or sub-module.\n- **Keywords / Tags / Skills / Interests / Categories:** Relevant keywords, tags or categories associated with the course with a focus on Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.\n- **Links:** Hyperlinks to access the course or learning material directly.\n\n\n# License\nThe **Learning Path Index Dataset** is openly shared under a permissive license, allowing users to utilize the data for educational, analytical and research purposes within the Data Science, Machine Learning and AI domains.",
