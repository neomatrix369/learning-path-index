It started off as an idea at the end of **Cohort 2** of the [KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program](https://www.kaggle.com/kagglex) brainstorming and feedback session. It was one of the ideas to create byte-sized learning material to help our KaggleX mentees learn things faster. It aspires to simplify the process of finding, evaluating, and selecting the most fitting educational resources.\n\n# Context\nThis dataset was meticulously curated to assist learners in navigating the vast landscape of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI education.
